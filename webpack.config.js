    // the <script src="url_for_bundle.js"/> need to match this
    // BUT, is it should be a wds config rather than webpack config?? (wds cli has --content-base which allow to specify directory for '/' which is virtual)
    //                  more thoughts
    // the author of webpack created this `publicPath` property for `loader` providers
    // e.g. css-loader needs to handle the `url("imag/greentick.png")`, but where to fetch the png file?
    // the author of `css-loader` may refer to webpack.config.publicPath to figure it out if he/she likes (most don't, which render this configuration meaningless)
    // `wds` also take a hint from it, which is where the [virtual directory] thing comes from
